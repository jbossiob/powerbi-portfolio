# Powerbi-Portfolio
Information exists everywhere and everything can be measured. The fun is knowing how to take the right data, analyze it and, above all, know how to tell stories with it. My name is Jose Luis Bosio, administrator and graphic designer turned data analyst. I am a data enthusiast with strong experience using Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI to analyze and visualize data.


This portfolio showcases my proficiency in Power BI and highlights my ability to visually communicate complex data effectively by combining my two passions: data analysis and creativity in telling stories with it.


## Project 1: National Telemedicine Center

Cenate is the national telemedicine center that provides virtual medical consultations from Lima to all of Peru. For its operation, it requires the analysis of medical records to find those hospitals that have demand for medical services but not for professionals in their regions.

This project consisted of the analysis of a large database, analyzing the diagnoses, treatments and dates of care of more than 10 million patients nationwide. Through this analysis, the recruitment of patients and the medical care provided, the following dashboards were developed that showed the results obtained in the operation.

## Project 2: Operations monitoring at Cenate

The project consisted of developing KPIs that make the performance of the medical staff visible. Concepts such as maximum installed capacity and maximum operating capacity were developed to abstract the entire analysis into three key indicators:

- Effective programming (%): # Patients scheduled / Maximum installed capacity
- Effective care (%): # Patients treated / # Patients cited
- Maximum capacity use (%): # Patients served / Maximum installed capacity

These three KPIs were implemented in each of the areas of Cenate in the daily monitoring of the operation, managing to substantially improve the performance of the medical staff and allowing bottlenecks to be prioritized.

## Project 3: Drinking water service monitoring

Dashboard monitoring allows you to geospatially locate the areas where the drinking water service is interrupted, generating three ranges: Service between 0 and 6 hours; between 6 and 12 hours and more than 12 hours of continuity per day. In this way, it is possible to carry out supervisions more efficiently and generate the necessary mechanisms for the water company to restore the service.

## Project 4: Monitoring of drinking water service supervision operations

For this project, different sources of information were used.
The operations monitored were calls from customers who had interruptions in their service. The main service channels, peak hours and days of service were analyzed.

Tracking purchases was also a key point. The water purification companies were monitored according to the stock of chemical inputs, facilitating supervision and ensuring the chlorination of drinking water at the national level.

## Project 5: Monitoring the meteorological phenomenon of "El Ni√±o"

Through the rain forecast of the national meteorological center, it was possible to establish daily monitoring of that infrastructure vulnerable to rain, landslides and floods. Managing to have an alert 24 hours before the impact that allowed prioritizing and executing contingency actions with greater effectiveness.
