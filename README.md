# Powerbi-Portfolio
Information exists everywhere and everything can be measured. The fun is knowing how to take the right data, analyze it and, above all, know how to tell stories with it. My name is Jose Luis Bosio, administrator and graphic designer turned data analyst. I am a data enthusiast with strong experience using Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI to analyze and visualize data.


This portfolio showcases my proficiency in Power BI and highlights my ability to visually communicate complex data effectively by combining my two passions: data analysis and creativity in telling stories with it.
